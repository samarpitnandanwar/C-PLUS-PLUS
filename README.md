# C++ Programming Language

C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for making things like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.

C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g., e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g., telephone switches or space probes).

C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.

## Installation

C++'s installation instructions vary by operating system. Follow the guide for the operating system you're running in your development environment, macOS, Windows, or Linux..

```bash
For Windows:

To install a C++ compiler in a Windows environment, download the Microsoft's "Visual Studio"
from the Visual Studio website. 
This will download a full IDE, including an editor, debugger and build systems.

To access your C++ compiler follow the C++ section in Visual Studio's 
Getting Started guide

For Linux:

Most (if not all) Linux distributions include GCC as their primary C++ compiler. 
Many Linux distributions also include CLang as an alternative C++ compiler. 
The C++ client libraries support both.

To install C++ in a Linux environment, install the appropriate packages for your distribution. 
For Debian and Ubuntu, this package is g++.

Install these packages using the following commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++

After the installations are complete, verify that you have g++ installed:

g++ --version

```
